//! Types for defining custom [Runtime](https://github.com/rustasync/runtime)s. See the
//! [Runtime](https://docs.rs/runtime) documentation for more details.
//! 
//! These types are only necessary when implementing custom runtimes. If you're only trying to
//! perform IO, then there's no need to bother with any of these types as they will have been
//! implemented for you already.
